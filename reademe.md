Launch notes
============

A smattering of to-dos:
1. ensure the urls and titles on the various pages have had the word "Dev" removed
..* http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/events/seminars
..* http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/events-dev
..* http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/events/archive
2. Click about and ensure there are no left over links to the wwwdev server (I removed all I found)
3. Get the files from github and put them somewhere on EBI servers
..* Update the links in the panes titled "JS, CSS, Handlebars"

Give it a spin, and in IE 9 too (I've done, but another round would be good)
